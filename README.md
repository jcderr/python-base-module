= Python Base API Module

This code is non-functional. The basic premise is that you can quickly create API modules starting from this
as your basis. base.Resource is a class that creates objects with attributes keyed to passed dicts. base.Manager
is an abstract class meant to be more of a logic engine/controller of sorts.

Do your worst.
